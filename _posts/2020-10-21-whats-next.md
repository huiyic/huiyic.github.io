I decided to give myself a few months to think about what I would invest my time in for the next few years.

Jumping out of a job without a next step might seem scary to many, and it probably is, in the midst of a pandemic where unemployment rates are at an all time high.

But I knew it was time for me when I didn't look forward to waking up in the mornings. I hardly had time to be with my loved ones, nor have blocks of time to think about life in general. And I am a stickler to having lots of personal time as it helps me feel content. My mental and physical health was taking a toll, and I acknowledged it.

I thought long and hard about what people call 'opportunity cost'. There were many 'what ifs'. Though, <a href="https://www.navalmanack.com/">The Almanack of Naval Ravikant</a> that I recently read encouraged me to go for it. 

> <i>Any moment where you're not having a great time, when you're not really happy, you're not doing anyone any favours. It's not like your unhappiness makes them better off somehow. All you're doing is wasting this incredibly small and precious time that you have on this Earth. Keeping death on the forefront and not denying it is very important.</i>

The book talks about wealth, happiness and philosophy, and it's one of the rare few books that I re-read whenever I am in need of some direction.

Ultimately, I am aware I am in a privileged position to even do something like this, and I am grateful for it.

I'm excited to learn new things, obtain new experiences, and dip my toes into areas that I have long wanted to but didn't have time. In the end, it's worth taking some time to think about big decisions that you'd commit yourself to for a few years.

And most importantly, it is to find something that makes you look forward to waking up in the mornings.
