28 more days.

I never had the chance to sit down and think about the next huge chapter of my life for quite some time. And that’s a good thing. Sometimes thinking too much gets you nowhere.

Now that there’s four more weeks left. And just so I have time to pen some feelings down.

I have trouble conveying my feelings into words. It’s kind of hard to describe my current feelings.

Every single day, my conflicted thoughts and feelings engulf me so much in sadness. This journey feels heavy. I don’t want to find a path splitting into two at a crossroads. I guess becoming attached is kind of a bad thing.

As much as I love it here, I need to find ways to become someone who can support others. Not the other way round.

I guess, if you miss out on certain opportunities, you’ll have to go create them yourself.
