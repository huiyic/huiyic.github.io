<center>That’s why I couldn’t be happier<br>
No, I couldn’t be happier<br>
Though it is, I admit<br>
The tiniest bit<br>
Unlike I anticipated<br>
But I couldn’t be happier<br>
Simply couldn’t be happier<br>
Well – not “simply”:<br>
‘Cause getting your dreams<br>
It’s strange, but it seems<br>
A little – well – complicated<br>
There’s a kind of a sort of a: cost<br>
There’s a couple of things get: lost<br>
There are bridges you cross<br>
You didn’t know you crossed<br>
Until you’ve crossed<br>
And if that joy, that thrill<br>
Doesn’t thrill you like you think it will<br>
Still -<br>
With this perfect finale<br>
The cheers and the valley – who<br>
Who wouldn’t be happier?<br>
So I couldn’t be happier<br>
Because happy is what happens<br>
When all your dreams come true<br>
Well, isn’t it?<br>
Happy is what happens<br>
When your dreams come true!<br></center>
