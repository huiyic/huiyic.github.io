## "Pay it forward."

In 2014, I had the opportunity to join <a href="https://enterprise.nus.edu.sg/education-programmes/nus-overseas-colleges/">NOC (NUS Overseas Colleges) Program</a>, where I joined <a href="http://carousell.com/">Carousell</a> when the team was less than 10 people. The founders inspired me to join the Silicon Valley program, where I spent a year in the Bay Area. I am so grateful for the opportunity because I just learnt so much from the people and environment there.

I am always reminded to pay it forward. This was something that the Carousell founder always told me to do, and to be grateful for what I have. 

We've been incredibly fortunate to have learnt so much from the industry, and we have heard very inspiring stories which we feel should be shared more widely with the world. As such, my fellow NOC friend Sylvia and I started <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5VkoUoEzqzk0IcAs3qdM5A/">SG TechBites</a>, where we hope to raise awareness about what it's like working in tech. 

Hopefully, this will inspire more people to work in tech, and to encourage more people to share their stories!
