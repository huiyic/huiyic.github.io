Hello! I’m Hui Yi, a Product Manager based in Singapore.

I love working on marketplaces and building products that help people better their lives. My favourite products include Swarm, Airbnb, Product Hunt, and of course, <a href="https://carousell.com">Carousell</a>.

I had wanted to start my own cafe as I loved baking, then <a href="https://huiyichia.com/2015/05/08/Loving-to-bake.html">I realised that baking and setting up your business are two entirely different things</a>. Somewhere along that journey, I developed a passion for startups and technology, and saw tech's potential to help people at scale.

I had an amazing year at Silicon Valley with <a href="https://www.loopcommerce.com/">Loop Commerce</a>, doing marketing and UX research. I was fortunate to be immersed in an incredibly inspirational environment working with talented people. Events like Startup School and SXSW made it all the more exciting to imagine the amount of impact we can make with startups and technology.

In my 5 years with <a href="https://carousell.com">Carousell's</a> Product team, I've worked on Growth, Community, Monetisation, Trust and Internal products, <a href="https://blog.carousell.com/new-carousell-chat-experience/">Chat</a>, <a href="https://blog.carousell.com/starting-discussions-on-groups/">Groups</a>, <a href="https://mobile.carousell.com">mobile web</a> and Buyer experiences.

In my free time, I like to try new things, just because life is too short not to. I love watching musicals, and I never get tired of Book of Mormon. My favourite actor is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nBFq9YFNwE&t=721s">Nic Rouleau</a>, who’s absolutely passionate about what he's doing. <br>

My interests include <a href="https://instagram.com/sconesandcream.sg">baking</a>, cooking, F45, and dabbling in Japanese covers on my small <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/kalo4521/">YouTube channel</a>.<br>

I also enjoy reading books on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/10538.Carl_Sagan">Cosmology</a> and wonder if I'll ever see extraterrestrials in my life time.<br>
