Hello! Iâ€™m Hui Yi, and am currently a Product Manager at Bytedance based in Shanghai. I'm with the Creator Marketplace team, exploring how we can help creators monetise while doing what they love!

I love exploring marketplace products and building stuff that makes people happy. My favourite products include Swarm, Airbnb, Product Hunt, and of course, <a href="https://carousell.com">Carousell</a>.

I had wanted to start my own cafe as I loved baking, then <a href="https://huiyichia.com/2015/05/08/Loving-to-bake.html">I realised that baking and setting up your business are two entirely different things</a>. Somewhere along that journey, I developed a passion for startups and technology, and saw tech's potential to help people at scale.

I had an amazing year at Silicon Valley with <a href="https://www.loopcommerce.com/">Loop Commerce</a>, and was fortunate to be immersed in an immensely inspirational environment working with talented people. Events like Startup School and SXSW made it all the more exciting to imagine the amount of impact we can make with startups and technology.

I've been incredibly lucky to have seen Carousell grow from a team of less than 10 to over 500. In my 5 years with <a href="https://carousell.com">Carousell's</a> Product team, I've worked on Growth, Community, Monetisation, Trust and Internal products, <a href="https://blog.carousell.com/new-carousell-chat-experience/">Chat</a>, <a href="https://blog.carousell.com/starting-discussions-on-groups/">Groups</a>, <a href="https://mobile.carousell.com">mobile web</a> and Buyer experiences.

I enjoy reading books on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/10538.Carl_Sagan">Cosmology</a> and wonder if I'll ever see extraterrestrials in my life time. I <a href="https://instagram.com/sconesandcream.sg">bake</a> occasionally, and try not to poison people in the process. 

I'm keen to explore the areas of building communities, the Creator Economy, F&B, making social impact and marketplaces. <a href="mailto:hui.ychia@gmail.com">Say hi</a> if you'd like to chat!
