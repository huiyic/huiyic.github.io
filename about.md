Hello! Iâ€™m currently doing product stuff at Carousell. I previously worked on TikTok Creator Marketplace at Shanghai, and also spent most of my early years at Carousell.

I love exploring marketplace products and building meaningful products. My favourite products include Swarm, Airbnb, and of course, <a href="https://carousell.com">Carousell</a>.

I had an amazing year at Silicon Valley with <a href="https://www.loopcommerce.com/">Loop Commerce</a>, and was fortunate to be immersed in an immensely inspirational environment working with talented people. Events like Startup School and SXSW made it all the more exciting to imagine the amount of impact we can make with startups and technology.

I had an incredible journey at Shanghai with TikTok Creator Marketplace where I got to enable creators to make a sustainable living doing what they love. Living the China life meant trying out their ever so convenient deliveries, bike-sharing journeys and learning Chinese tech lingo from my colleagues.

I've been super lucky to have seen Carousell grow from a team of less than 10 to over 500. In my 5 years with <a href="https://carousell.com">Carousell's</a> Product team, I've worked on Growth, Community, Monetisation, Trust and Internal products, <a href="https://blog.carousell.com/new-carousell-chat-experience/">Chat</a>, <a href="https://blog.carousell.com/starting-discussions-on-groups/">Groups</a>, <a href="https://mobile.carousell.com">mobile web</a> and Buyer experiences.

I enjoy reading books on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/10538.Carl_Sagan">Cosmology</a> and wonder if I'll ever see extraterrestrials in my life time. I <a href="https://instagram.com/sconesandcream.sg">bake</a> occasionally, and try not to poison people in the process. 

I'm keen to explore the areas of building communities, the Creator Economy, F&B, making social impact and marketplaces. <a href="mailto:hui.ychia@gmail.com">Say hi</a> if you'd like to chat!
